## How many are you?

In the first lecture, we ran a parallel protocol for counting attendance:

 - Rightmost person per row counts all in row
 - When done counting, raises hand
 - State number in row when called on

after which the instructor gets to gather and sum the row counts.

In practice, this took X time.  This includes

 - Time to start the process
 - Time to compute row counts
 - Time for the instructor to gather counts
 - Time for instructor to do the arithmetic

Consider the following questions:

1. What is a simple model that would predict this time?

Time to start: T_s
Time to count one person in a row: T_c
Number of seats in one row: m
Time for the instructor to gather one count: T_g
Number of rows: n
Time for instructor to do the one add: T_a

x1 = T_s + m*T_c + n*T_g + n*T_a

This prediction assumes uniform distribution of seats in each row.


2. What about a simple model to predict time for one person to count?

x2 = T_s + m*n*T_c


3. How big should the class be before the parallel method takes less time?

x1 < x2

=> T_s + m*T_c + n*T_g + n*T_a < T_s + m*n*T_c

=> n > m*T_c/ (m*T_c - T_g - T_a), only when m*T_c > T_g + T_a, which is supposed to be true in real case
